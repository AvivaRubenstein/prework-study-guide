          <li> The "head" element contains information about the webpage. (meta info for the browser)</li>
          <li>The "body" element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The body first has a "header", with the largest heading font being h1, and going up to h2 etc makes a smaller sub heading</li>
          <li>Next we go into the "main" section, which can be broken up into many "sections", each with their own h2 heading.</li>
          <li>Once the "main" is closed, we move to the "footer", close the "body", and then the "html" file as a whole.</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS RULE TEMPLATE=  selector {property: value;  property: value;} </li>
        <li>CSS rules have a selector, which tells you what the rules apply to, followed by brackets containing declarations about the rule,</li>
        <li>the brackets can contain multiple declarations, each with a property, such as "color" "text-align" "margin" or "padding"</li>
        <li>followed by a colon, and then the value of that property, for example, "blue" as the value of "color".</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>a * selector means that the rule will apply to all elements on the page </li>
        <li>you can apply a rule to more than one type of element by writing both selectors followed by a comma before starting the brackets with the rule</li>
        <li>ex: header, footer {width: 100%; height: 120px;}</li>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Write JavaScript notes here</li>
        <li>We link the js file to html by adding a "script" element in the footer</li>
        <li>Use console.log(ojectName) to output a message to the web console</li>
        <li>You can use this to print out the value of that variable/object.</li>
        <li>To see what's in the console, load the html file into our browser and right click. Click "Inspect" and navigate to the "Console" tab.</li>
        <li>You can define a function by writing the word function, followed by the name of the function, parentheses (with parameters if needed), and then curly brackets which contain what you want the function to do. </li>
        <li>it should look like: function functionName () {code we want to run when function is called }</li>
        <li>Then, we can call the function by writing: functionName(); </li>
        <li>Remember that the js code runs top to bottom, so the order of creating a variable or a function and then using those vars or functions matters!</li>
        <li> </li>
        <li>We also learned about for loops and conditional logic (if - else) statements.</li>
        <li>A for loop will complete the task we want many times, as long as the conditions we want are still truthy</li>
        <li>for loops contain: 1. a starting point for the loop - we declare var x and give it a value:  var x = 0;</li>
        <li>2. the condition. Example: As long as our var x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running: x < shapes.length; </li>
        <li>3. statement which allows the for loop to rerun for each item in the array :  x++;  or  x + 1; - this will increase x by one each time the code loops. </li>
        <li>format: for (var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) { //code block - console.log(shapes[x]);  -will print each item in the array to the colsole }</li>
        <li> </li>
        <li>Condition logic- if statements:</li>
        <li>code will only execute IF the statement meets a condition or is true.</li>
        <li>if (first condition) { //block of code }</li>
        <li>else if (second condition) {//block of code }</li>
        <li>else (final condition) {//block of code }</li>
        <li>for the condition, to check whether a var equals exactly a certain value, we say : (var topic === "javaScript") - if it's true, the condition is truthy and the code will run.</li>
